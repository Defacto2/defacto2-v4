defacto2-version4-from-2010-march-10
====================================

This is the redundant source code of the Defacto2 web application referred to as version 4.

It was initially created in 2003 but various parts of the code was amended and modified multiple times over the years until it was retired in mid-2010. As such it is a bit of a hacked job, messy and poorly documented.

The code itself requires Adobe ColdFusion 8 or higher, Microsoft IIS 6 and the SQL database needs to be hosted on 
MySQL 4.1 or 5.

The application expects to be hosted in the local directory of 'c:/websites/urk7tb/'.

The MySQL datasource is expected to be named 'defacto2net'.

Most of the web application's settings can be found in Application.cfc or in the sub-directory /CFC

The recommended IDE to view this code is Eclipse combined with CFEclipse.
